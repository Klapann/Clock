# Clock
Here's my clock project, the one project I struggled with the most 

This project had to be my least favorite. I took forever to do it because I just struggled so much coming up with a concept for it. Though my final product isn't my favorite thing it's what I wanted, something simple and usable. I really like the line I put moving in the background, it should be timed correctly but even if it isn't it really catches my eye and it took forever to figure out how to integrate into the code I already had.
